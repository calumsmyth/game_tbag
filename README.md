AI-Driven Software Development boot camp project.

Project in writting a texted based adenture game (TBAG).

This is a TBAG where the hero (player) stumbles upon a random inviting castle.
Within the castle the player is able to move between rooms and look around the room.
Each room contains a character which the player can talk to, bribe, give a gift and fight. 
Player is also able to check their own inventory and add an item to it by completing a miniquest. 
Input is not case sensitive and it is possible to get game overs, so be sure to interact with those creepy characters carefully!

Hints:
  - Where 'yes/no' answered are required, it will be stated in the terminal.
  - Fights and gifts need a specific item to be typed, I dare you to find out what happens if you spell it wrong.
  - I hear Dave isn't a big fan of cheese, and Dr. Acular doesn't really like steaks (although I don't think he was talking about food necesarily).
  - Jade is looking for her dance partner, maybe he is close by? She has something which may come in handy, but she isn't one to give things up for free. If only she had that necklace which she is so annoyed about forgetting.
